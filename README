Todo - A simple web app written with Scala and Play
=================================

Dependencies
-------

* Java JDK 6 (minimum)

Running the app
-------

From a terminal, `cd` to the cloned directory and run `./activator run`.
This will download all the needed dependencies for building and running the application.

You should eventually see a message like this -

```[info] play - Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000```

At this point you can navigate to `localhost:9000` in your browser.
